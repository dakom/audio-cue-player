# audio-cue-player
Audio Cue Player - a simple electron-based WebAudio cue player.

Built for a personal project but a useful tool in a pinch!

## Prerequisites
install jquery and bootstrap

1. `npm install jquery --save`
2. `npm install bootstrap --save`

## Configure
1. Add audio files to CUES folder
2. edit cueplayer/config/config.js (see comments there for more details)

## Notes
Probably works in a regular browser too, just change the PATH at the top of player.js and be careful with global vars
